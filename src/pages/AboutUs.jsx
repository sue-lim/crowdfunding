        <strong>Bringing dignity back,</strong> one shower at a time...
        Not everyone has the luxury to access a hot shower on a daily basis and possibly not even on a weekly basis! A shower isn't just about hygiene but it can provide a huge sense of dignity to an individual in needâ€¦
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to give back dignity - <strong>one hot shower at a time...</strong>

        <h6>Why ...</h6>
        <p>
        A mobile shower facility would be beneficial for the homeless population in Perth for several reasons:</p>
        <br/>
         <p>
          <li><strong> Improved hygiene:</strong> One of the main challenges faced by homeless individuals is access to basic hygiene facilities, such as showers. A mobile shower facility would provide a safe and clean space for individuals to bathe, improving their overall health and hygiene.</li>
          <br/>
          <li><strong>Increased self-esteem:</strong> Homelessness can often lead to feelings of shame and low self-esteem. Access to a mobile shower facility can help individuals feel clean and refreshed, which can improve their self-esteem and confidence.</li>
          <br/>
          <li><strong>Enhanced job prospects:</strong> Maintaining personal hygiene is crucial for job seekers, especially for those who work in customer-facing roles. Access to a mobile shower facility can help homeless individuals clean up before job interviews, which can increase their chances of finding employment.</li>
          <br/>
          <li><strong>Reduced risk of illnesses:</strong> Poor hygiene can lead to various health problems, such as skin infections and respiratory illnesses. Providing homeless individuals with access to a mobile shower facility can help reduce the risk of these illnesses, which can ultimately save lives.</li>

         
          </p>
          
          <h6>How ...</h6>
          <p>
        We currently have 2 buses donated from an old transport hiring service. Our <strong>mission</strong> reinvent & repurpose them into a mobile shower facility. That is our first goal. Once this takes off, we would love for volunteers from the all backgrounds including possible doctors to also give back time to community but as always one step at a time.
