        <strong>Bringing dignity back,</strong> one shower at a time...
        Not everyone has the luxury to access a hot shower on a daily basis and possibly not even on a weekly basis! A shower isn't just about hygiene but it can provide a huge sense of dignity to an individual in needâ€¦. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to give back dignity - <strong>one hot shower at a time...</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We currently have 2 buses donated from an old transport hiring service. To do that our <strong>mission</strong> is to reinvent & repurpose them into a mobile shower facility. That is our first goal.Once this takes off, we would love for volunteers from the all backgrounds including possible doctors to also give back time to community but as always one step at a time.
